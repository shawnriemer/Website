### website

The end goal of this project is to create a website showcasing a variety of baseball-related projects. Accomplishing this goal will serve three primary purposes:

1.	Serve as a portfolio for my work should I pursue a baseball analytics job
2.	Help me develop analytical skills including web development, ML, writing, etc.
3.	Allow me to dive deeper into my interests and create something to share with the baseball community

While each project is separate, creating a website allows me to easily share all of my work at once and continue making improvements and additions. Web development is not a skill that I claim to possess, but with the help of a website creator I can realize my vision, described below.

The home page should include some interesting visual to draw attention. Maybe the same visual that showcases a different player daily, maybe something else. It will include an overview table on Statcast category leaders. A random baseball quote will break up two sections. It should include links to my most recent/most interesting work. The most recent @StatcastAwards tweet can be embedded. Maybe the reigning weekly award winners and most popular tweets as well.

The Statcast Leaders page will show yesterday's and the season's leaders in a variety of Statcast categories.

The Articles page should include different blog posts that I have written. The shift-ban analysis will be the first example, and others (maybe even analyzing the luck of my vintage baseball card collection) will follow as I come up with things. Current ideas include strikezone analysis, roster construction, and wildest pitches.

The Streak page should include a tool for determining the best MLB Beat the Streak options for the day. There should be a way to filter who is eligible (if someone wants a player from a specific team, etc.). There should be some level of explanation and documentation as to how it is making its decisions. Challenges include keeping up with daily batting lineups.

The Scouting Reports page should include detailed, interactive (if possible) visualizations. At a minimum there should be a different one for batters and pitchers. Visitors can enter a player and the metric to break down their numbers by (such as wOBA, OBS, etc.).

One potential page is a pitch predictor, which takes in a scenario and predicts what pitch the pitcher will throw. It can also show every similar instance and the outcome.

Finally, the About page will tie my name to the website. It will describe my background and any interest in getting a baseball-related job, should I decide to pursue one. It will contain my contact information so interested visitors can reach me. It will link to my LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub. Maybe even my Venmo in case anyone with spare money likes my work and wants to buy my next burrito from Chipotle.

Repositiories will be created for the actual work that creates all the content shown throughout the website, this repo is simply for the website itself.
